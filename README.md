# rolling_back_transactions

```
1) Created a rolling back transactions in situations where it's important that all transactions are successful imported.
2) The amount must be greater than zero no more than the account balance return 0.0.
3) There will be a shown balance and the code for that is going to be print balance on account.
4) I have also implemented SQLite3 to start storing the transaction details in a database.
5) In the database, there are accounts table and transaction table.
6) The account table just stores the name of the account and the account balance.
7) The transaction table stores time of the transaction the account that the transaction relates to, as well as the amount.
8) I've added the TIMESTAMP field to demonstrate how to cope with dates.
